# R You Ready
## An Introductory Data Science Workshop in RStudio

### Requirements

This is a workshop completely for beginners- no coding or machine learning experience is needed. However, participants should have R and RStudio installed prior to the workshop. Bringing pencil and paper is also highly recommended, as there are many definitions and equations involved in the workshop.

### End Goal

Students will be familiarized with the R statistical computing environment - it's awesome! Also, participants will get an idea of the foundational models in data science, which are used in the first phases of a project to recognize patterns, understand the data, and formulate a hypothesis.
